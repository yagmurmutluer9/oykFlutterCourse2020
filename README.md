 - If you have some knowledge on Programming you can easily learn Dart. 
 > It mostly a static language but there are two types 'var' and 'dynamic'. Both of them use when we won't limit the type of things. 
 > If a variable type is dynamic, it can change types without borders on the same variable. 
 - Flutter do not have public, protected types but if you add "_" in front of the variable, it makes private.
